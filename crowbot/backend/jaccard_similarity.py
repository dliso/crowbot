def jaccard_similarity(statement, other_statement, threshold=0.7):
    """
    Calculates the similarity of two statements based on the Jaccard index.

    The Jaccard index is composed of a numerator and denominator.
    In the numerator, we count the number of items that are shared between the sets.
    In the denominator, we count the total number of items across both sets.
    Let's say we define sentences to be equivalent if 50% or more of their tokens are equivalent.
    Here are two sample sentences:

        The young cat is hungry.
        The cat is very hungry.

    When we parse these sentences to remove stopwords, we end up with the following two sets:

        {young, cat, hungry}
        {cat, very, hungry}

    In our example above, our intersection is {cat, hungry}, which has count of two.
    The union of the sets is {young, cat, very, hungry}, which has a count of four.
    Therefore, our `Jaccard similarity index`_ is two divided by four, or 50%.
    Given our threshold above, we would consider this to be a match.
